       "'Context and key figures\\n- Property type: Residential multi-family building tends to benefit from diversified occupancy, economies of scale in property management, and shared maintenance for common areas. This generally lowers per-unit admin and some maintenance costs while affecting vacancy risk differently than single-family homes.\\n- Actual purchase price: €850,000\\n- Theoretical total value: €920,000\\n- Building share of value: 68.5% (≈ €630,200)\\n- Land share of value: 31.5% (≈ €289,800)\\n\\n1) How the property type influences management costs and rent-loss risk\\n- Management costs (admin and maintenance)\\n  - Residential multi-family buildings typically incur admin costs for centralized property management, accounting, tenant communications, and leasing activities, often allocated on a per-unit basis. The admin figure (€2,840.50) aligns with a modest to mid-sized multi-unit portfolio when scaled per unit.\\n  - Maintenance costs (€8,520.75) reflect ongoing upkeep for common areas, building systems, exterior maintenance, and pro-rated repairs across multiple units. While total maintenance tends to be higher in multi-family properties due to shared systems and more extensive common areas, economies of scale often keep per-unit costs lower than in a single-family portfolio.\\n  - Overall, the split shows a structure typical for multi-family assets: administration is a fixed/overhead component with scalable efficiency, while maintenance scales with asset size and age.\\n- Risk of rent loss (vacancy risk)\\n  - For a multi-family building, vacancy risk is spread across several units, generally reducing the impact of any single vacancy on the total cash flow. The stated risk of rent loss at 2.0% reflects a stabilization scenario and is consistent with diversified occupancy.\\n  - In contrast, single-family properties are more exposed to vacancy swings because a single vacancy can represent a larger portion of gross income. The 2% vacancy assumption for a multi-family asset implies a lower per-unit vacancy risk due to market diversification and tenancy turnover distribution.\\n\\n2) Inflation impact and the CPI-based adjustments\\n- Inflation context\\n  - CPI (October prior year) = 128.4; base CPI (October 2001) = 100.0; index factor = 1.2840.\\n  - The administration (€2,840.50) and maintenance (€8,520.75) costs are inflation-adjusted using the CPI index factor of 1.2840. The stated amounts therefore reflect current-year costs after applying the 28.4% uplift from the base-year values.\\n- What this means for the valuation\\n  - Since costs were escalated by 1.2840, the implied base-year costs were lower. This inflation adjustment reduces real net cash flow if rents do not rise proportionally, which can temper the net operating income used in capitalization.\\n  - Rough back-calculation (approximate, using the factor 1.284):\\n    - Admin base ≈ €2,212\\n    - Maintenance base ≈ €6,640\\n    - Risk of rent loss base ≈ €1,401\\n    - Total base-year costs ≈ €10,253\\n    - Current total costs ≈ €13,161\\n    - Inflation increased annual costs by roughly €2,908 (≈ 28.4%), highlighting the sensitivity of NOI to CPI movements in this period.\\n  - Implication: If actual rents and other income do not keep pace with the CPI-driven cost increases, the net operating income could be pressured, potentially reducing the capitalization-derived value unless the cap rate adjusts accordingly or rents rise with CPI.\\n\\n3) Value comparison: Theoretical value vs actual purchase price\\n- Theoretical total value: €920,000\\n- Actual purchase price: €850,000\\n- Premium/discount relative to income potential\\n  - Purchase price as a premium/discount: €850,000 is €70,000 below the theoretical value.\\n  - Discount magnitude: (920,000 − 850,000) / 920,000 ≈ 7.6% discount to the theoretical value.\\n  - Relative to purchase price, buyers paid about 92.4% of the theoretical value, indicating a modest discount to the income-generating potential as captured by the Ertragswertverfahren.\\n- Implications\\n  - The 7.6% discount provides a modest margin of safety relative to the calculated income potential, which can improve implied yield if rents grow in line with CPI and if operating costs rise as projected (but note the CPI-driven cost increases discussed above).\\n  - The land value (≈ €289,800) versus building value (≈ €630,200) align with the typical structure of the valuation, where the bulk of value resides in the building’s income-generating capacity and the land provides enduring value. The purchase price being below the total theoretical value suggests potential upside if occupancy and rent levels sustain or improve and if capital expenditures are kept within planned limits.\\n\\nBottom-line implications\\n- The property’s multi-family nature supports economies of scale in admin and provides vacancy diversification, which is favorable for stabilizing cash flow but warrants careful monitoring of rent levels against CPI-driven costs.\\n- The CPI-based inflation adjustments raise annual operating costs by about 28.4%, which can dampen NOI unless rents track CPI increases or capital expenditures are controlled.\\n- The purchase price (€850,000) is a ~7.6% discount to the theoretical value (€920,000), indicating a favorable entry relative to income potential, assuming reasonable rent growth and effective cost management in line with the CPI-adjusted framework.'"
